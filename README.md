### Hiya! I'm Evgeni ğŸ‘‹

I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Goldsmiths where we are working on making robotic harvesting commercially feasible. Alongside this, I am currently doing my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at Imperial College London. Prior to this, I spent 4 years working at SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale selling equity derivative products & quantitative investment solutions to hedge funds.
